<div style="border-radius: 15px; border: 2px solid #d0d0cc; padding: 8px; text-align: left;">Carl is a Sr. Principle Engineer, passionate to effect change with innovative designs and strategic forward thinking theory and practice reducing complexity of health care software while reducing the cost of health care. Carl is taking an opportunity to reach a broader audience by providing and demonstrating new technology solutions that expand our opportunities to lower healthcare costs while fulfilling his passion to improve processes and performance. Carl design & coded a Natural Language application in the form of a Web Assembly that can be used Enterprise wide to capture conversations to text and then apply Natural Language Processing to provide meaningful clean data to be data mined with future Machine Learning applications.  

Carl designed and built a Machine Learning application to automate and track Prior Authorizations at an enterprise level to be the Source of Truth, while providing Machine Learning to provide the best answer and audit tracking. This application should save 40 million in claim disputes, payments & FTE’s because it is difficult to determine if a Prior Authorization was required or not consistently determined today.

Carl works on patents for the software applications he has designed and developed, to help Optum reach its goals to increase the number of registered patents for Optum.  

Carl guides, mentors, and lead efforts to strategically position projects into a DevOps model to take full advantage of AGILE, Continuous Integration, Security Code Scanning and Penetration best practices. Carl guides SCRUM Teams into the DevOps Model by architecting solutions that put the Business in charge of functionality deployments when Business wants to provide new functionality.  

Carl has designed and written an automated letter generating application that saved UHG 14 million dollars in FTE costs over 3 years  

Carl designed and lobbied for MCD-Online which is an SOA solution with API and Web Sites to put UHG into a better position to compete for M&V contracts. This effort included Azure Cloud Solutions, and Cyber Security including NIST and FISMA concerns that included Code Scanning and Penetration testing in a Continuous Integration SDLC. This effort saves the company 8,000.00 dollars a year in hosting costs.

Carl provides leadership direction to transform a project and team that was failing to demonstrate any demonstrable progress to the Business Owners in the first 6 sprints. That effort is now in Production with Zero Defects within 10 Sprints. To accomplish this Carl provided options & input to the PMC on solutions and feature sizes. He provided guidance to Product Owners & Scrum Teams to write better Features and User Stories from a technologist’s perspective. With input at all levels with in an Agile Team he was able to add value by transitioning a failing project into a successful project.
